            <h2>Team Lebron - Author: takingmytalenttosoutchbeach</h2>

            <p>Any Lebron fan, or basketball fan doesn't need to point the obvious on Lebron supernatural ability in the stats sheet, or the dominance the team has when he is on the court. After all, all those can be easily disregarded with a person who watches basketball in the different era. But we should focus on the things that are comparable, such as longevity. 
            
            I believe what put Lebron on top is this longevity. Starting at 18 years old, he has played 51,524 min in his career, being the third highest minute played player of all time. Here is the kicker, he is still playing, in the highest level, while the other top 14 guys had long been retired. He is far from another older veteran player on the team right now, he is virtually playing the highest quality of basketball, from 19 years ago. 
            
            This is the reason why this can easily put Lebron in the highest spot of basketball. On surface, the longevity shows his ability to take care of his body, the consistency in diets, and recovery method. But more importantly, it shows his far superior ability and mastering in the game of basketball, no matter how the game change, how offense and defense evolve, he will understand the game and understand how he can win regardless.</p>
